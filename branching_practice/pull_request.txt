In this file we will make notes of pull requests.

When we are working in teams or if we want to organise our work a bit better instead of merging branches directly we can use gitHub to open up 
or raise pull requests.
Pull requests represent a merging task so they have a source branch where the work is being done and a target branch into which the new changes
will be merged.
