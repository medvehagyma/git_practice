git status
This will tell us which branch we are currently on, which files have untracked changes,
which files have changes to be commited and how many commits we currently have.
It can also give us information about any ongoing operations that we are doing, like merge conflict resolutions
and interactive rebasings. This is an extremely handy and common git command. Many people will use git status after every other command they execute.

git add <files-to-be-tracked>
Eg.: git add readme.txt
Sometimes we don't want to track every single change that has been made. For example if your file system contains files that store your personal data
you don't want to share that with your colleagues, so you don't version control those files. Whatever you want to version control, you add to the "staging
area" with git add.
Special case:
git add .
This will add every single currently untracked change to the staging area.
The staging area contains the changes not yet committed, but that you want to commit.

git commit -m <commit-message>
Eg.: git commit -m "Add more text to readme.txt"
When you are done adding all of your changes to the staging area and you are happy with the current changes, you can make a "snapshot" of the current
state of the repo saying that you are done implementing whatever you were working on in this commit. The commit message should briefly explain what
the changes in this commit are about.
Special case:
git commit -a -m <commit-message>
If you don't want to separately execute "git add ." for tracking all the current changes you can just add the -a flag and that will automatically
run it before commiting.
