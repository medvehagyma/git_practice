This is the first file in this repo.

This second line is written by Falesz after being invited. People or "collaborators" 
can be added to remote repositories on GitHub and then they can push commits to the repo.

This file is in a versioncontrolled folder called a repository.
When I make a change in this folder, I can use the following command to tell git, that i made a change that I would like to versioncontroll.
git add <file_name>
When I am satisfied with the changes I can tell git that I would like to keep these changes with the following command.
git commit -m <commit message text>

-m is short for message
The commit message should be a brief description of the changes contained within the commit.
Commit message convention
when you want to write a commit message ask to yourself what will this commit do 
the answer this commit will ... "make these changes"

Git is a versioncontroll system that tracks changes in text files. 
This is tipically used by programmers writing code. So it's a program that runs on your computer.
Git will be controlled with commands, the most important ones are git status, git add, git commit, git push, git pull.

GitHub is a hosting service, it provides free servers where programmers can put their remote repositories.
This allows them to work together on the same codebase asynchronously.
